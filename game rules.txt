- Two worlds (Hopefully this helps with Practical 7)
- Ground World - Food items
- Sky World - Coins
- Player can move between both worlds
- The player must collect all items from both worlds.

Initialisation:
- Elements must at least be one cell radius apart from each other.
  - Choose number of elements based on size of array.
  
- Player must be placed in a random empty location
  - Player starts in the ground world.
  
Movement:
- Player can move up, down, left, right.
- Player can also switch worlds.
- Player cannot move outside of any of the worlds (outside the bounds of the array[s]).

Update:
- When player moves over a food item or a coin, the player collects it.

End-Game Logic:
- The game ends when the player collects from both worlds.
